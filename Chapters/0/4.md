# Variables in programming

We getting closer to writing our first program. But first we need to understand variables. We have already explained what they are in chapter [0.2. - A little bit of mathematics](2.md), but that chapter focused on variables in mathematics. In programming they work a little bit differently, but they essentially do the same job of 'naming' data. In this chapter we will discuss:

- 1. Types of variables
- 2. Advanced data types
- 3. Conclusion

One key concept which applies to all variables in programming is their **capacity**, that is to say the maximum and minimum values they can take. This limitation exists because variables are just bits in the computers memory, and a fixed number of bits at that. You can't store the value of [googolplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googolplex) (which is just a really massive number) in a few bytes of memory.

## Types of variables

In school you mostly (maybe even only) used variables to describe numbers, like $x=4$. But in programming variables can be much more than just numbers. Variables can store text, boolean values, or even raw binary data. The basic variable types come in 5 flavours:

### Integers

Integers are whole numbers, like $4$, $1239$ or $-87$. Some languages have multiple types of integers with different capacities (for instance in C you have 8,16 and 32 bit integers to name a few). Some languages also support signed and unsigned integers. To put it simply signed integers support negative numbers, whereas unsigned ones don't.

#### Integers in binary

The computer will store the value $12$ of a 8bit (2byte) integer as $00001100$ in binary format. With negative values it gets a little bit more complicated. You could, for instance, simply 'store' the sign in the first bit (make it $1$ if it is negative and  $0$ if it is positive). While this is a completely valid approach, it isn't what computers use, as the alternative allows for much faster computation. Computers use the **[two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement)** system for storing signed integers.

#### Two's complement

In the two's complement system a number is stored following the following rules (I will give an example for the number $-37$ and an 8bit value):

1. First you start with the binary format of the number (of the positive value), in our case that would be $00100101$
2. Then we would flip (invert) all of the bits, so we get $11011010$
3. Finally add 1 to the flipped value, this makes the two's complement representation of $-37$ to be $11011011$

Positive values are stored without steps 2. and 3.

### Floats

Floats are a type of variable that can all real numbers. Where integers can only store the $3$ part of $3.14159$, floats can store the real correct value. They are called float because of the way they store these values, using [floating point notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#Overview). This basically means they store the number in binary and then 'move' the point to where it should go.

#### Floating point notation
I will be describing the standard floating point notation for 32bit wide numbers. The 32 bits are divided as such:
| 1 | 8 | 23 |
| -- | -------- | ------- |
| Sign (S) | Exponent (E) | Fraction (F) |

- Sign (S) - represents the sign of the number ($1$ means negative and $0$ means positive)
- Exponent (E) - the 'position of the decimal point'
- Fraction (F) - the value of the number, before 'setting' the decimal point

The value of a number in floating point notation is calculated as follows (we will use an example of $0 10000000 11000000000000000000000$):
1. Whether the number is negative or not is immediately known based on the value of S, this number is positive since $S=0$ 
2. Then we find the real value of the fraction (we will name it $f$). If $E=0$ Then the fraction is $0.F$, and if $E!=0$ then the fraction is $1.F$. In our case, since E is not 0, the value of the fraction is $f=1.11000...$ (still in binary).
3. Then we find the real value of the exponent (we will name it $e$). If $E=0$ then $e=-128$, and if $E!=0$, then $e=E-127$. In our case we have $e=128-127=1$ (the E section is an unsigned integer value, explained above in the [Integers](#integers) section).
4. Then we just multiply the fraction by two to the power of the real exponent $e$.
Then we get the following expression $N = f * 2^e$, which equates to $N=1.11 * 2^1 = 11.1$. Now we will convert from binary to decimal. The part before the decimal point is equal to $1 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 3$ and the part after the decimal is equal to $1 * 2^-1 = 0.5$. So the final value in decimal is $N=+3.5$.

### Booleans
Booleans are variables which have two possible values, `true` or `false` (sometimes represented as `1` and `0` respectively). There is not much more to be said about them.

### Characters
Characters are a type of variable which holds, well, characters. They are stored as unsigned integer values which are mapped to certain characters dependent on their encoding. The size of this variable depends on the encoding, for instance the [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) and [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) encodings produce 8bit variables, while [UTF-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16) produces 16bit ones. An example of these number-character mappings would be how the english alphabet is mapped in ASCII format:
| number | character |
| - | - |
| A | 65 |
| B | 66 |
| ... | ... |
| Z |  90 |
| a | 97 |
| b | 98 |
| ... | ... |
| z | 122 |
### Strings
A string is a data type which represents a series of characters. It is basically any text. Different programming languages handle strings differently, some might save the individual characters one after another in an array (more on that later) and add an *end* character after them to signal the end of a string (typically the character with number value $0$), while others may save them along with their length.

## Advanced data types
Sometimes these basic data types just aren't enough. Imagine you want to store the wallet balances of hundreds of customers. You may think to just store them all into separate variables individually, but in practice this is just not feasible. This is where advanced data types like arrays come in handy.

### Arrays
Arrays simply represent a collection of multiple variables. In the example mentioned above, you could just make an array which 'houses' 100 integers. To retrieve a variable from an array you need to *index* it. Indexing basically means 'telling' the array which element you want (the first, second, third, ...).

| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | ... | 99 |
| - | - | - | - | - | --- | -- |
| 12 | 49 | 162 | 7 | ... | 5 |

This is an example of an array with $100$ integers. You will notice it does not start at 1, but rather at 0. This is simply how it is in programming (with most programming languages), as it is much simpler for the computer to 'follow along'.

Arrays need not only contain integers, they can contain floats, strings, booleans, even other arrays and more advanced data types.

### Dictionaries
Dictionaries are like arrays, but rather than using numbers to index their elements, you use other variables. For instance if you wanted to keep the names associated with individual phone numbers, you could use a dictionary which uses strings as keys (meaning you index it using strings) and strings as values (meaning the elements are also strings), this would look something like this:
| "0671234567" | "061876543 " | ... |
| ------------ | ------------ | --- |
| "John Smith" | "Jane Doe" | ... |

## Conclusion

In conclusion, understanding variables is a fundamental aspect of programming. We've explored various types of variables, including integers, floats, booleans, characters, and strings, each serving a unique purpose in storing and manipulating data.

Throughout this chapter, we've discussed how variables are declared, their naming conventions, and their scopes within a program. We've also delved into the limitations imposed by the capacity of variables, highlighting the constraints imposed by memory allocation in computers.

Moving forward, a solid understanding of variables will serve as the building blocks for writing more complex programs. In the next chapters, we'll delve deeper into programming concepts, exploring data structures, control flow, and algorithms, empowering you to write efficient and robust code.
